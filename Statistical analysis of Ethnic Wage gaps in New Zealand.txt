Executive summary
This paper estimates the contribution of differences in measured personal and job
characteristics to New Zealand’s ethnic wage gaps. There are substantial and persistent
gaps between the average hourly wages of Pākehā, Māori and Pacific employees. Survey
estimates published by Statistics NZ show that the average hourly wage earned by Māori
employees was 82% of the average hourly Pākehā wage in 2017, while the average wage
earned by Pacific employees was 77% of the average Pākehā wage.
The purpose of the paper is to investigate the extent to which ethnic group differences in
demographic, productivity-related or job characteristics may be contributing to the ethnic
pay gaps. The Treasury has produced this paper as one of its contributions to He kai kei
aku ringa, the previous Government’s Māori economic development strategy.
The paper uses 2016-17 data from the Household Labour Force Survey and standard
Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition methods. The statistical models used here indicate that
ethnic differences in personal and job characteristics account for 68–73% of the MāoriPākehā hourly wage gap for males, 75% of the Māori-Pākehā wage gap for females, 39–
55% of the Pacific-Pākehā wage gap for males, and 41–55% of the Pacific-Pākehā wage
gap for females.
Educational level and occupation are the two factors that have the largest impact on
Māori-Pākehā and Pacific-Pākehā wage disparities, amongst all those considered. In our
models of the Māori-Pākehā wage gap:
•

differences in highest qualification account for 18–22% of the wage gap for males and
22–25% of the wage gap for females

•

differences in occupation account for 26–28% of the wage gap for males and 21–24%
of the wage gap for females.

In our models of the Pacific-Pākehā wage gap:
•

differences in highest qualification account for 19–22% of the wage gap for males and
20–22% of the wage gap for females

•

differences in occupation account for 31–33% of the wage gap for males and 29–33%
of the wage gap for females.

This implies that reducing ethnic differences in educational attainment and/or occupational
status could help to reduce the size of the aggregate wage disparities.
The ‘unexplained’ parts of the wage gaps could be caused by a variety of factors,
including ethnic group differences in skills that haven’t been included in the models (such
as the field of the qualification that is held, English language proficiency, detailed
occupational skills, or firm-specific skills and experience); differences in preferences for
different jobs because of their non-wage characteristics, and discrimination.
Future research could use other methods, such as field experiments and interviews with
employers, to gain insights into the causes and effects of ethnic discrimination in the
labour market.

1 Introduction
This paper estimates the contribution of differences in measured personal and job
characteristics to New Zealand’s ethnic wage gaps. There are substantial and persistent
gaps between the average hourly wages of Pākehā, Māori and Pacific employees. Survey
estimates published by Statistics NZ show that the average hourly wage earned by Māori
employees was 82% of the average hourly Pākehā wage in 2017, while the average wage
earned by Pacific employees was 77% of the average Pākehā wage. These ratios have
not changed materially in recent years, as shown in Figure 1 (there has been movement
from year to year but no consistent upward or downward trend).
The paper uses 2016-17 data from the Household Labour Force Survey and standard
Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition methods. The purpose of the paper is to investigate the
extent to which ethnic group differences in demographic, productivity-related or job
characteristics may be contributing to the ethnic pay gaps. Treasury has produced this
paper as one of its contributions to He kai kei aku ringa, the Government’s Māori
economic development strategy.
Ethnic wage gaps are the focus of the paper. For a broader perspective on the
employment and economic outcomes of the New Zealand Pacific population, see Krieble
and Gamperle (2016). For a broader perspective on Māori employment, see Ministry of
Business, Innovation and Employment (2017).
Section 2 describes the methods. Section 3 provides summary statistics on ethnic group
differences in wages and wage-related characteristics. Section 4 gives the results of the
decompositions. Section 5 discusses the interpretation of the findings, their limitations,
and directions for further research.

2 Methods
2.1 Data sources
Our main data source is the June 2016 and June 2017 quarters of the Household Labour
Force Survey (HLFS). Income questions are asked in June quarters only in the HLFS.
We pool data from the latest two years of the survey in order to increase sample sizes.
We don’t use data for earlier years because of changes to the questionnaire between
2015 and 2016, altering some of the key variables.
The Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI) is a secondary data source, which is used solely
to derive a measure of time spent in wage or salaried employment during the past 5
years, for each person in the study population.

2.2 Study population
The study population includes all wage and salary earners aged 15-69 years who
provided responses to the survey questions on their earnings, directly or through another
member of their household.
Respondents whose earnings responses were later imputed by Statistics NZ – because
they answered the core HLFS questions but not the additional earnings questions – are
not included in the sample for analysis. Fourteen percent of records were excluded
because of the imputation of the person’s earnings. Approximately 40% of earnings
responses in the remaining sample were provided by a proxy respondent – that is, by
another member of the family.

2.3 Definitions and relative size of each ethnic group
Ethnic groups are defined as in Table 1.
Table 1: Ethnic group definitions
Group

Definition

Māori

People who gave ‘Māori’ as one of their ethnic groups

Sole Māori

People who gave ‘Māori’ as their only ethnic group

Pākehā

People who gave ‘European’ or ‘Pākehā’ as one their ethnic groups

Pacific peoples

People who gave any of the Pacific ethnicities as one of their ethnic
groups. This includes all of the islands of the Pacific (Polynesia and
Melanesia).

The Pākehā group incorporates 73.3% of wage and salary earners in the sample; the
Māori group 12.4%; sole Māori 6.4%; and the Pacific peoples group 6.3%.

It has become standard practice to define ethnic groups in an inclusive way, counting
everyone who listed the specified group as one of their ethnicities. This means that the
ethnic groups overlap (with the exception of the sole Māori group). Figure 2 shows the
extent of overlap between the three main ethnic groups within our sample of wage and
1
salary earners.

combinations, HLFS June quarters 2016-17

5%
The biggest overlap is of Pākehā and Māori. 5.7% of all wage and salary earners said
they were both Pākehā and Māori, and this sub-group made up 46% of the entire ‘Māori’
ethnic group, and 7.7% of the entire ‘Pākehā’ ethnic group.
Approximately 85% of all wage and salary earners are accounted for in Figure 2. The
other 15% were not members of any of the three ethnic groups that are the focus of this
2
paper (and were instead classified to the Asian, MELAA or other ethnic groups).

2.4 Measure of earnings
The measure of earnings used in this paper is the worker’s total before-tax average hourly
earnings in their main job. The main job is defined as the one in which the respondent
usually worked the most hours. The words ‘wage’ and ‘average hourly earnings’ mean the
same thing in this paper and are used interchangeably.

Note that the results in Figure 1 are for wage and salary earners only. The ethnic composition of all
persons in employment – including the self-employed – differs from this. Pākehā are more likely than
Māori and Pacific peoples to be self-employed, and therefore they make up a larger proportion of all
persons in employment.
Middle Eastern, Latin American or African.

2.5 Other variables
Most personal and job variables used in this paper were sourced from the HLFS. We
added a measure of employment history by linking administrative data on wage and salary
earnings during the past 5 years to each individual’s HLFS record. We then count the
number of calendar months in the 5-year-period in which any wage or salary earnings
were recorded. This gives a rough measure of employment continuity.
88% of individuals in the sample had already been linked to an identity in the Integrated
Data Infrastructure by Statistics NZ. Additional linkages were made by Treasury by linking
individuals living at the same address with matching gender, year of birth and month of
birth. The final linkage rate was 96%.

2.6 Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition
Oaxaca (1973) and Blinder (1973) introduced an approach for estimating wage
discrimination which has been much used in the literature on gender and ethnic earnings
disparities.
Consider two ethnic groups, group 1 and group 2, where group 1 is a numerically
dominant ethnic group (such as Pākehā in New Zealand), and group 2 is a minority ethnic
group. Log wage regressions are estimated separately for the members of each ethnic
group, by regressing a set of covariates Xi on the log of wages. These take the form:
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖1 = 𝛽𝛽1 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖1 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖1

𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖2 = 𝛽𝛽 2 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖2 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖2

(1a)

(1b)

where the 1 and 2 superscripts denote the two ethnic groups, the i subscript denotes the
ith wage earner, and w stands for wages. X represents a vector of explanatory variables,
such as age and education.
Because OLS regression lines pass through the means of each of the variables, the log
wage gap between the two groups is equivalent to:
1 1
2 2
��������
��������
��������
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑤𝑤 1 − ��������
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑤𝑤 2 = 𝛽𝛽
𝑋𝑋 − 𝛽𝛽
𝑋𝑋

(2)

1
����
where 𝑋𝑋
and ����
𝑋𝑋 2 are vectors containing the means of the explanatory variables for each
ethnic group, and β1 and β2 are the vectors of estimated coefficients from the group 1 and
group 2 wage regressions.

Given this result, the log wage differential can be decomposed in various ways. Oaxaca
proposed the following forms:

and

1
��������
������������
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑤𝑤 1 − ��������
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑤𝑤 2 = �𝑋𝑋
− 𝑋𝑋 2 �𝛽𝛽1 + �𝛽𝛽1 − 𝛽𝛽 2 �𝑋𝑋� 2

(3a)

1
��������
������������
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑤𝑤 1 − ��������
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑤𝑤 2 = �𝑋𝑋
− 𝑋𝑋 2 �𝛽𝛽 2 + �𝛽𝛽1 − 𝛽𝛽 2 �𝑋𝑋�1

(3b)

The first term on the right-hand side of these equations represents the part of the log
wage differential that is due to the ethnic group differences in mean characteristics. If the
characteristics included in X are age, education, experience, and other direct or indirect
measures of skill, this term can be interpreted as measuring the effects of differences in
the groups’ current average productive capacity on the ethnic gap in earnings.
The second term in the equations represents the effect of ethnic group differences in the
estimated coefficients, which represent the log wage returns to characteristics. There are
several possible sources of these differences in returns. They may be due to unmeasured
differences in the level or quality of the characteristics that are included in the equation; to
other measurement errors in variables; or to ethnic group differences in skills or productivityrelated characteristics that are unmeasured in surveys, and therefore omitted from the
regression. They may partly reflect ethnic group differences in preferences for non-wage job
characteristics. They may also be due to discriminatory differences in the wage rates that
people of different ethnicities receive for a given level of skills. Because the interpretation of
the second term in the decompositions is problematic, and can’t be attributed solely to
discrimination, we focus on the first term in this analysis of ethnic wage gaps.
There are two possible weighting schemes in the Oaxaca decomposition. The first
weighting scheme (3a above) uses the Group 1 wage structure to value (ie, assign a price
to) the attributes of both ethnic groups. Intuitively, this assumes that the dominant ethnic
groups’ wage rates are unaffected by discrimination, and would prevail in the absence of
discrimination against ethnic minorities. The converse is true of the second weighting
scheme (3b above). (3a) is typically used in the ethnic wage inequality literature.
Neumark (1988) suggested a more general weighting method:
1
��������
������������
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑤𝑤 1 − ��������
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑤𝑤 2 = �𝑋𝑋
− 𝑋𝑋 2 �𝛽𝛽 + ��𝛽𝛽1 − 𝛽𝛽�𝑋𝑋�1 − �𝛽𝛽 2 − 𝛽𝛽�𝑋𝑋� 2 �

(4)

where β is estimated from a pooled regression of all employees. This version is intuitively
appealing if one believes that the wage structures of all groups are influenced by the
unequal treatment of different ethnic groups in the labour market. The (employment
weighted) overall average coefficients are assumed to be a reasonable representation of
the prices for different attributes that would prevail if all groups were treated equally in the
labour market.

The choice of weighting scheme for the decomposition can lead to significant variations in
the results obtained. In this paper we present results using two alternative weighting
schemes, following equations 3a and 4. The first version, which weights the gap in
productive attributes with the coefficients from the Pākehā regression (the largest ethnic
group), is the weighting method most commonly used in research on ethnic wage
differentials. The second version, which uses the coefficients from a pooled regression as
weights, is also presented because it does not require such strong assumptions about the
alternative wage structure that would prevail in a labour market free from ethnic inequities.

3 Ethnic group differences in wages and
characteristics
Table 2 shows the mean hourly wages of the employees in each ethnic group in 2016-17
(using June 2017 dollar values). The ratio of the Māori mean to the Pākehā mean is 82%,
or 80% in the case of sole Māori. The ratio is higher for females than for males, by about
5 percentage points. The ratio of the Pacific mean to the Pākehā mean is 76%. As for
Māori, the ratio is higher for females than for males.

The mean age of this sample of Māori wage and salary earners was about 2 years younger
than the mean age of the Pākehā sample. The Pacific peoples’ sample was about 3 years
younger on average. The sole Māori sample, in contrast, was similar in its age structure and
average age to the Pākehā sample (and older than the full Māori sample).
Māori and Pacific males were more likely to be joint parents of dependent children, and
slightly more likely to be sole parents of dependent children, than Pākehā males. Turning
to females, the proportion of Māori who were sole parents was much higher than the
proportion of Pākehā, while Pacific women were more likely to have dependent children in
both partnerships and as sole parents.
The regional profiles of the ethnic groups are different, with Māori being less likely than
Pākehā to live in the Auckland, Wellington and Canterbury regions and more likely to live
elsewhere in the North Island, and Pacific peoples being far more likely to live in Auckland
than anywhere else. Two-thirds live in Auckland.
The qualification profiles also show some quite large ethnic group differences, with
Pākehā holding higher qualifications than the other two groups on average. For instance,
36% of women in the Pākehā sample held a degree, compared with 23% of Māori women
and 19% of Pacific women.
Counting the number of calendar months in the past 5 years in which income from wages
or salaries was earned (any amount), we find that Pākehā workers had somewhat greater
employment continuity than Māori or Pacific workers. The male means are 48.6 months
for Pākehā, 46.1 months for Māori, and 44.6 months for Pacific peoples. The female
means are 47.2 months for Pākehā, 43.3 months for Māori, and 41.7 months for Pacific
3
peoples.
Turning to current job characteristics, we consider hours worked because there is a
correlation between part-time hours and lower wages for workers in general, but the
results show very little difference between the mean weekly hours of the different ethnic
groups. Job tenure (ie time spent in the current job) is positively correlated with wage level
on average, and the tenure measures do show some small differences, with Māori and
Pacific employees having lower job tenure on average.
Occupation is a key determinant of earnings, and the statistics on the proportion of each
ethnic group in each 1-digit occupational group indicate that Pākehā were much more
likely to hold managerial or professional jobs, and much less likely to be in the two least
skilled occupational groups (machinery operators and drivers and labourers), compared
with Māori and Pacific peoples. The industry statistics show that Māori were more likely
than Pākehā to work in the primary industries, in manufacturing, or in transport, postal and
warehousing, while Pacific peoples were more likely to work in manufacturing or in
transport, postal and warehousing.

4 Contribution of differences in
characteristics to the ethnic wage gaps
Table 4 and Table 5 set out our estimates of the contribution of differences in measured
characteristics to the hourly wage gaps, using the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition method.
Note that these decompositions are carried out using the natural log of wages rather than
wage levels. This is the standard approach, adopted because taking the log of each
person’s wage makes the distribution of the wage variable less skewed to the right, so
that the mean is closer to the centre of the wage distribution and closer to the wage
earned by the typical worker.
In Table 4, coefficients from a wage regression using the Pākehā sample were used to
weight the mean differences in characteristics. In Table 5, coefficients from a wage
regression using people of all ethnic groups are used to weight the differences in
characteristics. If Pākehā are rewarded more highly for each characteristic, then the first
weighting approach will tend to lead to higher estimates of the ‘explained’ portion of the
total ethnic wage gap.
The results of decompositions using personal characteristics only are presented in the
upper section of the tables. The variables included here are age, highest qualification,
parental status, region and employment continuity (measured by the number of months of
wage or salaried employment in the past 5 years). Age is a proxy measure of employment
experience. Highest qualification is a proxy measure of job-related skill level. Parental
status is a productivity-related characteristic because it can affect individuals’ preferred
hours of work or willingness to work in particular jobs and locations. Region of residence
is a productivity-related characteristic because labour is more valuable in regions of higher
labour demand. The employment continuity measure is another measure of employment
experience.
Focusing on Table 4, the first five variables (age, highest qualification, parental status,
region and employment continuity) together explain 59% of the Māori-Pākehā wage gap
for males and 68% of the Māori-Pākehā wage gap for females. The difference in
qualifications makes the largest contribution, with smaller contributions coming from age,
region of residence, employment continuity, and parental status in the case of females.
Māori employees are younger, less likely to live in higher paying regions such as
Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch, and if female are more likely to be sole parents.
They had slightly less employment continuity than Pākehā (as shown in Figure 3).
The explanatory power of these ‘personal’ variables is lower when sole Māori are
compared with Pākehā (reflecting, among other things, the fact that the sole Māori group
is older than the total Māori group). It is substantially lower when Pacific peoples are
compared with Pākehā. These variables explain 16% of the Pacific-Pākehā wage gap for
males and 21% of the Pacific-Pākehā wage gap for females. The difference in
qualifications makes the largest contribution to the wage gap between Pacific peoples and
Pākehā, with a smaller contribution coming from differences in age (reflecting the fact that
Pacific employees are younger). The regional location of Pacific peoples has a negative
sign in the decomposition (reducing the total explanatory power of the model), because
Pacific peoples are disproportionately located in Auckland, a region in which Pākehā
wages are higher than average. This residence pattern should lead to higher wages for
Pacific peoples, but it does not. Two thirds of the Pacific peoples in the sample were living
in the Auckland region, compared with 28% of Pākehā and 21% of Māori.

The results of decompositions using information on both personal and job characteristics
are presented in the lower section of the tables. The additional variables included in the
second set of wage regressions as explanatory variables are hours of work; job tenure;
whether the job involved a non-standard employment relationship (fixed-term,
employment agency, casual, or seasonal); 1-digit occupation and 1-digit industry. These
job characteristics were chosen because measures are available in the HLFS and they
are empirically associated with significant wage variations in the labour market.
In Table 4, the full set of variables included in the second regression model explains 73%
of the Māori-Pākehā wage gap for males and 75% of the Māori-Pākehā wage gap for
females. In these Māori-Pākehā wage gap decompositions, occupation plays the biggest
role, accounting for about 26% percent of the entire wage gap for males and 21% for
females. Highest qualification is the second most important variable. Age, region of
residence and industry each make a small contribution. Differences in hours of work, job
tenure, and type of employment relationship are of little importance once the other
variables have been included.
The explanatory power of the full set of variables is similar but lower when sole Māori are
compared with Pākehā.
The variables included in the second regression model together explain 39% of the
Pākehā-Pacific wage gap for males and 41% of the Pākehā -Pacific wage gap for
females. Occupation is the most important explanatory variable, with highest qualification
also making a strong contribution to the total wage gap. Parental status, region and hours
of work all make very small negative contributions to these decompositions, indicating that
the distribution of these characteristics among Pacific peoples is slightly more favourable
towards higher wage levels than the distribution among Pākehā.
By comparing Table 4 and Table 5 we can see that the choice of weighting scheme
makes little difference to the decomposition of the Māori-Pākehā wage gap. The
‘explained’ proportion is only slightly higher in Table 5 (see the bottom rows of Table 4
and Table 5). It is a different story for the Pacific-Pākehā wage gap: using the coefficients
from the pooled sample wage regression (ie using data for all ethnic groups) materially
raises the ‘explained’ proportion of the Pacific-Pākehā wage gap for both males and
females, from less than 40% to about 55%.
It’s worth noting that the explanatory power of every factor is influenced by the choice of
other variables to be included in the model. The explanatory power of education in the
decomposition of the Māori-Pākehā wage gap, for example, is reduced by about 12
percentage points when job characteristics are also included. Therefore, this method does
not give a definitive, single result for the role of a specific factor like education when
understanding ethnic wage differences. The models are most useful in giving an indication
of the relative importance of specific factors, such as age or education, relative to the
other factors that have been included in the same model.

5 Summary and discussion
5.1 Summary
This analysis has estimated the statistical contribution of a number of measured
productivity-related characteristics to ethnic wage disparities.
We find that educational level and occupation are the two factors, among the set of factors
considered, that have the largest impact on Māori-Pākehā and Pacific-Pākehā wage
disparities. In the full models for the Māori-Pākehā wage gap, differences in highest
qualification account for 18–22% of the wage gap for males and 22–25% of the wage gap
for females, while differences in occupation account for 26–28% of the wage gap for
males and 21–24% of the wage gap for females. In the full models for the Pacific-Pākehā
wage gap, differences in highest qualification account for 19–22% of the wage gap for
males and 20–22% of the wage gap for females, while differences in occupation account
for 31–33% of the wage gap for males and 29–33% of the wage gap for females.
This implies that reducing ethnic differences in educational attainment and/or occupational
status could help to reduce the size of the aggregate wage disparities.
These statistical models account for 68–73% of the entire Māori-Pākehā wage gap for males,
75% of the Māori-Pākehā wage gap for females, 39–55% of the Pacific-Pākehā wage gap for
males, and 41–55% of the Pacific-Pākehā wage gap for females. The remaining portions of
the wage gaps could be caused by a variety of factors, including differences between ethnic
groups of other characteristics that haven’t been included in the model (such as the field of
the qualification that is held, English language proficiency, detailed occupational skills, and
firm-specific skills and experience); differences between ethnic groups in preferences for
different jobs because of their non-wage characteristics, or discrimination.
About 18% of the Pākehā wage earners in the study sample and 54% of the Pacific wage
earners in the study sample were born overseas. Therefore, a more complete explanation
of the Pacific-Pākehā wage gap would need to take into account the effects of being an
immigrant on earnings, including the effects of variations in English language skills,
variations in social capital and social networks, and discrimination against migrants.
These factors would also be important for any future analysis of Asian wage earners.

5.2 What have we learnt about ethnic wage gaps?
Ethnic group differences in hourly earnings are partly due to ethnic group differences in
productivity-related characteristics and partly due to differences in job characteristics. Part
of each pay gap remains unexplained. The ‘currently unexplained’ portion is larger for
Pacific peoples than for Māori.
Because of the statistical importance of ethnic differences in educational attainment and
occupational status, reducing the size of these differences would be particularly useful.
Alongside these pay gaps, there is also the issue of higher unemployment rates for Māori
and Pacific peoples compared with Pākehā. As at June 2017, the unemployment rate for
Pākehā was 3.4%, for Māori it was 11.1% and for Pacific peoples it was 10.1%. Reducing
the gaps in education attainment could also help to reduce the unemployment rates for
Māori and Pacific peoples.

5.3 What have we learnt about discrimination?
Many Māori and Pacific people experience discrimination (see, for example, Statistics
New Zealand 2016). This is backed up in a range of studies, described in Section 5.4
below. This particular paper, however, is not designed to robustly test for discrimination.
Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions were originally developed as a tool for estimating how
much of a particular wage gap might be due to discrimination. Historically, some
researchers who presented Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions attributed the ‘explained’
portion of the wage gaps to differences in the average productivity of each group, and the
‘unexplained’ portion to discrimination.
Most labour economists no longer support this interpretation and have moved onto using
other methods to study discrimination. There are several reasons why the ‘unexplained’
portion of ethnic wage gaps can’t be validly attributed to discrimination.
First, as already noted, the current regression models don’t include all dimensions of
workers’ skill and labour market productivity, only the aspects for which data are available.
For example, we only know the highest qualification of each worker, and not the subject
field, the year and institution where the qualification was obtained, or whether multiple
qualifications are held. Nor do we have measures of other types of skill that also influence
earnings, such as literacy skills, numeracy skills, and written communication skills.
Another important gap is that we have little information on workers’ employment history,
but much of the skill variation that leads to wage variation is acquired on-the-job over the
course of a worker’s lifetime, and is influenced by the organisations worked at and the
specific roles that are undertaken. Because the measures of skill included in the model
are so limited, the impact of ethnic skill differences on wages is likely to be significantly
under-estimated. This in turn means that the portion of the wage gap that is ‘unexplained’
by productivity-related characteristics is likely to be significantly over-estimated.

The Survey of Adult Skills (2014) provides some evidence of differences in the skills of
Pākehā and Māori who have the same level of highest qualification. Figure 3 reproduces
Figure 9 and Figure 10 from a Ministry of Education and Ministry of Business, Innovation
and Employment report (2016, pp13-14). It shows that Māori adults in each educational
attainment group have lower literacy and numeracy skills, on average, than NZ Europeans
in the same educational attainment group.
Second, discrimination in the labour market or in the wider society may influence the
development of workers’ skills and productivity-related characteristics in a variety of
different ways. For example, if the educational outcomes of Māori and Pacific youth are
partly due to the low expectations of their teachers, or the students’ own perceptions of
the jobs they are likely to be employed in, then their current educational attainment has
potentially been influenced by discrimination. Similarly, a worker’s employment history and
their current job characteristics (and earnings) can clearly be shaped by discrimination if
there is discrimination in hiring. This means that the ‘explained’ component of the wage
gap is not free from the effects of discrimination, and discrimination, if it exists, is likely to
be contributing to both the ‘explained’ and ‘unexplained’ portions of the earnings gap.

5.4 Other types of evidence on discrimination
Because of the difficulties of identifying discrimination using regression decompositions,
this approach has been largely replaced in the economics discipline by other approaches,
such as production-function analyses in which the productivity of each worker is estimated
and compared with their wages, and experiments that are designed to study the behaviour
of people in contexts where discrimination can occur. These methods are reviewed in
Neumark (2016). Experimental evidence is favoured on the grounds that this type of
evidence is more able to demonstrate the existence of discrimination, provided the
experiments are well designed.
Reviewing the evidence from experiments conducted in the US, Newmark notes that
much of this evidence provides confirming evidence of hiring discrimination, especially
with respect to respect to ethnicity and race (ibid, p73). Newmark says that ‘this review
reinforces the conclusion that hiring discrimination is pervasive’ (p.74). If discrimination in
hiring reduces the likelihood of applicants from ethnic minorities being recruited or being
recruited to better-paying jobs, then it is likely to be one of the causes of ethnic gaps in
average earnings. This could be the case in New Zealand as well as in the US.
There is a small body of literature on bias against Māori in hiring decisions. This mostly
comprises psychological laboratory experiments or self-reported attitudes in surveys or
interviews. For example, McKenzie (1996) finds bias in attitudes towards Māori among
employers surveyed. A further body of work finds bias against other ethnic groups such as
Indian and Chinese, such as Wilson et al (2005) and Wilson and Parker (2007).
Using a sample of 210 university students, Singer and Eder (1989) test perceptions of
highly qualified and less qualified Māori with and without strong Māori accents. Māori
applicants were less likely to be shortlisted than Dutch applicants. In a similar psychology
study, Jackson and Fischer (2007) test perceptions of Māori and Pākehā in a laboratory
experiment. They presented two sets of identical resumes to 114 Pākehā undergraduate
psychology students. Identical high-qualification resumes were presented. Of these, Māori
were rated slightly more favourably than high-merit Pākehā. However, when lowqualification resumes were presented, the identical Māori resumes were rated lower.

There appears to be a gap in the literature: using experiments and data from real
employers to explore the occurrence of and reasons for discrimination against Māori and
Pasifika. Jackson and Fischer (2007) write:
“...relatively less research has been conducted on the effects of applicant ethnicity
in written job applications (i.e. curricula vitae or application forms), particularly
comparing Māori and New Zealand European/ Pākehā applicants.”
A decade later, in 2018, this appears to still be the case.
The best current evidence that ethnic minorities may face a higher level of discrimination
than Pākehā comes from the New Zealand General Social Survey, 2014. This found that
26% of Māori felt they had been discriminated against over the last year, as did 20% of
Pacific peoples and 27% of Asian peoples, compared with 15 percent of New Zealand
Europeans. 4 These figures include all forms of discrimination on all grounds (eg, gender,
ethnicity, age, appearance, or disability).

5.5 Future research
Neumark (2016) notes that while there is extensive experimental evidence on
discrimination in hiring, studying the role of discrimination in other employer decisions
(such as pay setting or promotion) has been much more difficult, and a comparable set of
experimental evidence on discrimination in pay decisions or promotions does not yet exist.
He argues that future experimental research should do more than simply demonstrate that
some population groups face employer discrimination in hiring. To design good policy
responses, the nature of and the reasons for the discrimination need to be known. These
may vary across different contexts and population groups. For example, groups that are
noticeably different from the employer’s population group may face ‘taste’ discrimination,
while groups that present a potential employment issue that is unknown or unpredictable at
the time of recruitment (such as mothers of young children or people who have previously
experienced a mental illness) may face statistical discrimination (Neumark, 2016, p.77).
Field experiments should ideally be supplemented with survey or interview evidence on what
employers know, what information they use, what assumptions they make, and how this
changes during the search, interview and job offer process (ibid, p76), in order to build better
evidence about the basis for employer discrimination. This could possibly build on the methods
used recently in South Auckland by the Auckland Co-Design Lab (2016) to investigate the
issues and barriers perceived by employers when they seek to hire young school leavers.
Another challenge for the experimental research is determine whether the situations in which
discrimination has been shown to occur are representative of what happens in the rest of the
labour market. Conducting studies in a wider range of occupational and firm settings may help.
At a broader level, Treasury will monitor ethnic differences in income and material
standard of living as part of its work on the Living Standards Framework. The Living
Standards Framework aims to achieve higher living standards for New Zealanders, and
will involve developing a set of indicators that go beyond economic measures to include
wellbeing and sustainable development. This will include further analysis of factors
associated with relatively good and poor outcomes.
